NAME
    Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter - A DNS ad filter

VERSION
    version 0.072

DESCRIPTION
    This is an ad filter for use in a local area network. Its function is to
    load lists of ad domains and answer DNS queries for those domains with a
    loopback address. Any other DNS queries are forwarded upstream, either
    to a specified list of nameservers or to those listed in
    /etc/resolv.conf.

    The module loads externally maintained lists of ad hosts intended for
    use by the *adblock plus* Firefox extension. Use of the lists focuses
    only on third-party listings that define dedicated advertising and
    tracking hosts.

    A custom blacklist and/or whitelist can also be loaded. In this case,
    host listings must conform to a one host per line format.

    Once running, local network dns queries can be addressed to the host's
    ip.

SYNOPSIS
        my $adfilter = Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter->new();

        $adfilter->run();

    Without any parameters, the module will function simply as a proxy,
    forwarding all requests upstream to nameservers defined in
    /etc/resolv.conf.

ATTRIBUTES
  adblock_stack
        my $adfilter = Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter->new(

            adblock_stack => [
                {
                url => 'http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=adblockplus&showintro=0&startdate[day]=&startdate[month]=&startdate[year]=&mimetype=plaintext',
                path => '/var/named/pgl-adblock.txt',     #path to ad hosts
                refresh => 7,                             #refresh value in days (default = 7)
                },
                {
                url => "abp:subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Feasylist-downloads.adblockplus.org%2Feasyprivacy.txt&title=EasyPrivacy&requiresLocation=https%3A%2F%2Feasylist-downloads.adblockplus.org%2Feasylist.txt&requiresTitle=EasyList",
                path => '/var/named/easyprivacy.txt',
                refresh => 5,
                },
            ],
        );

    The adblock_stack arrayref encloses one or more hashrefs composed of
    three parameters: a url that returns a list of ad hosts in adblock plus
    format; a path string that defines where the module will write a local
    copy of the list; a refresh value that determines what age (in days) the
    local copy may be before it is refreshed.

    A collection of lists is available at
    http://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions. The module will accept standard
    or abp:subscribe? urls. You can cut and paste encoded links directly.

  blacklist
        my $adfilter = Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter->new(

            blacklist => '/var/named/blacklist',  #path to secondary hosts
        );

    A path string that defines where the module will access a local list of
    ad hosts. A single column is the only acceptable format:

        # ad nauseam
        googlesyndication.com
        facebook.com
        twitter.com
        ...
        adinfinitum.com

  whitelist
        my $adfilter = Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter->new(

            whitelist => '/var/named/whitelist',  #path to exclusions
        );

    A path string to a single column list of hosts. These hosts will be
    removed from the filter.

  host, port
        my $adfilter = Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter->new( host => $host, port => $port );

    The IP address to bind to. If not defined, the server attempts binding
    to the local ip. The default port is 53.

  nameservers, nameservers_port
        my $adfilter = Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter->new( nameservers => [ $ns1, $ns2, ], nameservers_port => $port );

    An arrayref of one or more nameservers to forward any DNS queries to.
    Defaults to nameservers listed in /etc/resolv.conf. The default port is
    53. Windows machines should define a forwarder to avoid the default
    behavior.

  setdns
        my $adfilter = Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter->new( setdns  => '1' } ); #defaults to '0'

    If set, the module attempts to set local dns settings to the host's ip.
    This may or may not work if there are multiple active interfaces. You
    may need to manually adjust your local dns settings.

  loopback
        my $adfilter = Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter->new( loopback  => '127.255.255.254' ); #defaults to '127.0.0.1'

    If set, the nameserver will return this address rather than the standard
    loopback address.

  debug
        my $adfilter = Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter->new( debug => '1' ); #defaults to '0'

    The debug option logs actions to stdout and can be set from 1-3 with
    increasing output: the module will feedback (1) adfilter.pm logging, (2)
    nameserver logging, and (3) resolver logging.

CAVEATS
    Tested under darwin only.
